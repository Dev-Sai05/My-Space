Here‚Äôs a **detailed, step-by-step explanation** in **simple English** for COBOL screen FA0766 (screens 70765 and 70766), which deals with capturing and updating FATCA/CRS details for pre-existing **personal customers**:

---

## üßæ **Screen FA0766 Overview:**

- **70765**: Used to prompt and read existing data.
- **70766**: Used to update FATCA/CRS details.
- The system allows up to **5 tax residencies**.
- The **country from the electronic search** is shown as **read-only** and comes from 70765.
- The **TIN No.** from electronic search is **not mandatory**.

---

## üîÅ **A000-MAIN-PARA Logic (Main Process Start)**

### Initialization:
- Reset error flags and search flags.
- Prepare variables to track whether customer records exist.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **When Screen 70765 is Used:**

1. **PERFORM R100-READ-CRSP**  
   ‚Üí Reads customer data from the CRSP table.

2. **Check for Errors**  
   ‚Üí If error flag is 1, exit immediately.

3. **If CRSP Record Found** (`WS-CRSP-FOUND-FLAG = "Y"`)
   - Go to **V100-VERIFY-STEP**: 
     - This step checks the **ICRS table** for records matching the customer.
     - It loops and reads until it finds data or confirms no more records.

4. **If CRSP Not Found**
   - Try reading from the **CRCU table** via **R200-READ-CRCU**.
   - This is like a fallback source for retrieving customer information.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **When Screen 70766 is Used:**

1. **Read CRSP again** (just like 70765).
2. **If found**, then:
   - **PERFORM M200-70766-CRSP**:  
     - Moves values from input screen into the CRSP table structure.
     - This includes:
       - Address type
       - Birth details
       - Up to 5 Tax Residency countries and their TINs

   - **PERFORM U100-UPDATE-CRSP**:  
     - Updates CRSP table.
     - Involves:
       - Assigning step numbers (like 04/07)
       - Maker-checker logic
       - Inserting audit records (CRHH table)
       - Rewriting CRSP record to database
       - Triggering UTCUDI for logging changes

3. **If not found**, set error message (282).

## üìñ **Detailed Breakdown of Important Modules**

### üîπ R100-READ-CRSP

- Initializes data areas.
- Based on the screen number (70765 or 70766), populates the `CRSP` primary key.
- Calls DB to **READ** CRSP data.
- If found:
  - Marks it as found.
  - Saves a copy of the original data.
  - For 70765, it checks if `CRSP-STEP` is 07 or 06 ‚Äî if not, error is shown:  
    ‚û§ _"Kindly complete the due diligence first"_

- If not found: Marks CRSP not found.

---

### üîπ V100-VERIFY-STEP

- Checks ICRS table for related FATCA/CRS records.
- If found, schedules the 70766 screen for capturing additional details.

---

### üîπ R200-READ-CRCU

- Builds a key using data from screen 70765.
- Tries reading from **CRCU** table.
- If found ‚Üí fine.
- If not ‚Üí shows errors (like code 282).

---

### üîπ M200-70766-CRSP

- Maps user-entered data into `CRSP` record.
- Handles up to 5 tax residencies and TINs.
- If country is not OECD (`RK-OECD ‚â† 02`), clears self-certification fields.

---

### üîπ U100-UPDATE-CRSP

- Sets CRSP step as 04/07 (used for processing stages).
- Maker-checker logic is performed.
- Updates the CRSP table using REWRITE.
- Prepares before/after images for audit logging via `UTCUDICA`.
- Writes CRMC table (some additional audit or mapping).
- Calls UTCUDI to commit data to the system.

---

### üîπ S100-SCHEDULE-70766

- Schedules screen 70766 to be loaded after screen 70765 if needed.
- Sends control values for next screen execution.

---

### üîπ F100-CALL-FT0000

- A generic system module used to trigger the next screen transition.

---

## ‚úÖ **What Happens in Summary**

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| User opens screen 70765 | System tries to fetch customer data |
| If found | Verifies FATCA/CRS indicators |
| If not found | Tries alternate source (CRCU) |
| Screen 70766 | User can enter up to 5 Tax Residencies |
| Data validated | System rewrites CRSP record |
| Audit Trail | UTCUDI is called to track changes |
| If all goes well | Customer FATCA/CRS data updated successfully |
