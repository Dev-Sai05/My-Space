SR.No	ITEM	Microservices Check Point
1	Code Quality	 Code follows proper naming conventions.
		 No hard-coded values (all properties should be externalized and configurable).
		 Avoid redundant imports or unused variables.
		 Ensure proper exception handling (e.g., RrnException, SrcException).
		 Ensure logger (Logger logger) is used appropriately for debugging and tracking.
		
		
2	API Endpoints	Verify the correct HTTP method is used (e.g., POST in /PFMOBEnq).
		 Validate that @RequestMapping("/") works as expected with all the defined routes.
		 Ensure that @CrossOrigin() allows the intended origins only.
		
		
		
		
3	Input Validations	Ensure all validations (e.g., validateRefNum, validateTellerNum, validateOptionCode, validateCIFNumber) return appropriate error codes when invalid data is provided.
		 Test the system behavior for null, empty, or incorrect data in all input fields like ReferenceNumber, Option, PFNumber, MobileNumber, and CIFNumber.
		 Validate that @InitBinder blocks or allows the appropriate fields.
		
		
		
4	Error Handling	Validate that meaningful error codes and descriptions are returned (verify errno and errDesc generation).
		 Test all scenarios where validation fails and ensure correct error responses (via ErrorResponse).
		 Ensure error codes in the ErrorCodeMaster.properties file align with system behavior.
		
		
		
5	Database Integration	 Validate proper database connection initialization (dbconnection.getCBSDBConnection()).
		 Ensure the code properly handles failures when the database is unreachable.
		 Validate correct handling of database queries for options like PFNumber, MobileNumber, etc.
		
		
		
6	Security Headers	Ensure all security headers are correctly set in the response:
		X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
		X-Frame-Options: DENY
		Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
		X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
		
		
		
		
7	Performance & Load Testing	 Test how the service handles a large volume of requests (e.g., stress test the /PFMOBEnq API).
		 Ensure the performance impact of service calls (like callPFEnquiryChild and callMOBEnquiryChild) is minimal.
		
		
		
		
8	Security Testing	 Verify user authentication and authorization using headers like Teller_Number and Branch_Number.
		 Check that sensitive data (like PFNumber or MobileNumber) is masked or encrypted when logged.
		 Validate that Base64 encoding is correctly used when saving initial requests.
		
		
		
		
9	Data Validation and Sanitization	 Ensure all incoming request data is sanitized to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS).
		 Test for special character handling in fields like ReferenceNumber, PFNumber, and MobileNumber.
		
		
		
10	Functional Testing	 Validate the overall flow for getting customer details based on different Option values (PFNumber, MobileNumber).
		 Ensure the code handles different request formats (JSON vs. other content types).
		 Check the proper functioning of external service calls (e.g., database, JVM services like JvmLsCallCode and JvmLsEnvRecordArea).
		
		
		
11	Logging and Auditing	 Validate that sensitive data is not logged (e.g., passwords, tokens, mobile numbers).
		 Check that all key actions (e.g., successful requests, errors, invalid inputs) are logged.
		 Ensure logs are generated in the correct format and level (info, warn, error).
		
		
		
		
12	Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Testing	Ensure compatibility of the API when accessed from various browsers and platforms.
		 Test for CORS functionality when the API is accessed from different domains.
